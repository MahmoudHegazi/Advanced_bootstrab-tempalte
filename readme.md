JS it connected with ng desk server and has video chat 


This app able to send tickets on NG desk server and on my mail, also u can watch video on ask video and submit ticket
on the NG desk, I used Zaiper.com << when I asked their customer support can i connect ng desk with video ask
his answer No way to do that + NG desk not supported , But I did it easy Nothing can stop me even if app not supported

(How I connected it)
to submit a ticket to ng desk you have to send mail to ng server with your cst info and problem
so I connected video ask with gmail, and changed rules to send email to my ngdesk server with the
submited info from video ask , then I have the ticket سهولتها في صعبتها
